# parallex-example

This is a project demostrating pure CSS implementation of parallex effect inspired by http://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/.
Graphic design credit goes to my friend who is a professional designer.

It is currently not fully responsive. It will be improved soon.
